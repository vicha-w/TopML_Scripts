# Scripts for TopML Machine Learning project

This GitHub repo is a part of my bachelor's thesis named "Identification of top quark pair event from dileptonic decay channel by machine learning". Files in this repo are involved in the machine learning step only. For NTuple production, see `github.com/vicha-w/JetNTupleProduction`.

I will be adding a couple of files here soon. Stay tuned!
